# CryptoTick Bug Tracker Repo

This repo is used to track known issues with [CryptoTick iOS](https://cryptotick.co.uk). If you have a bug to report you can check the “Issues” tab up above to see if it's already been reported, otherwise create a new issue ticket.

### How do I report a bug?

To create a bug report, you'll first need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).

Next, go to the “Issues” tab, select “New Issue” and fill out the form. *Please* make sure you include as much information as possible to help me fix the bug!

### How do I find out if my bug has already been reported?

Go to the “Issues” tab at the top, and use the search bar to see if your issue already exists. If it does exist, you can add more information via the discussion (if you have extra info/steps on how to reproduce, please add it!). If your bug does not exist, please create a new report.

### What if I have a feature request, not a bug report?

Please report bugs at [this github repo](https://github.com/jclerico/Cryptotick-feature-requests)

### Can I participate in discussions here?

Yes you can! Please stay on topic to the specific bug report, and if possible add any extra information you have. If you just want to say "me too" (ie you are having the same issue), use the + button with the smiley on a comment to indicate your reaction. This allows me to see where most people are having the same bugs.
